        In the year 1966 most babies were born, who later became criminal. This is shown by an analysis of data from the Swiss Federal Office of Statistics. People with this vintage committed nearly 30,000 crimes to date. That's almost twice as many as people born in 1955.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">People born in the 1980s are also attracted by high crime rates. Unlike those born in the 1960s, they have a higher likelihood that they will commit extra crime, simply because they live longer lives.</p>
