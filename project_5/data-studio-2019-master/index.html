    <div class="story-body">
      <p class="body-text serif">The connection is obvious: The price determines how much the people smoke in Switzerland. In 1999, more than 100 packages of cigarettes per capita were sold. Twenty years later, the amount has almost halved. At the same time, the Federal Gouvernement steadily increased the price of cigarettes. In 1999, a pack of cigarettes cost just 4.5 Swiss Francs. 20 years later, the price has almost doubled.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The analysis of the relationship between the two variables shows that we have an almost perfect negative correlation. In other words, if the price of cigarettes rises, less packets are sold - so less smoking is done.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Interesting: The tax revenues that the Federal Gouvernement raises on the cigarettes have remained almost the same over all these years. Each year, they amount to around two billion Swiss Francs.</p>
