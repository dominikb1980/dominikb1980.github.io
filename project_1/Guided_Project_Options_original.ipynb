    "## Option 1: BBC 21st Century's greatest films\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016 the BBC polled 177 film critics to get their picks for the best films of the century so far. While the BBC's [aggregate poll](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films) is interesting, the long list including everyone who voted is perhaps more revealing from the data standpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films-who-voted\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for this project would be to scrape this page -- using beautiful soup and regular expressions -- in order to make a searchable database that would allow us to investigate all of the films listed by all of the critics.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose this project, the main challenge will be to design a database schema that organizes information by film, director, and/or by critic. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a geocoding standpoint we would visualize this data set based on the country of the critics, and we could, with extra research, view the data set by the country of the filmmaker. Perhaps there is more we could do geographically...\n",
    "\n",
    "From an exploratory standpoint, here are some questions we could ask: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which countries have the most directors?\n",
    "2. Which directors have the most movies selected?\n",
    "3. What year had the most movies selected?\n",
    "4. What are some other questions you can think of?\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall challenge, once the initial page is properly formatted into a database, is to find a way to enhance this data set with another source, and integrate that information with the information from the BBC poll.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious piece of missing data is the country of origin of the director. Country of origin for the movie it is actually quite difficult, productions are very international. One could also look into other secondary levels of information such as box office gross in different countries. It is up to you--the real challenge is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deciding on a secondary level of information that you think will be meaningful and interesting\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Finding, capturing, transforming  and joining that secondary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Advantages of this option:** It is very focused. It is flexible enough for you to take in your own direction, it is contained enough that is likely to be completed by the deadline. (While mapping by country is the most obvious route--world maps are inherently flawed. Feel free to focus on a single country. But if you do: try to find second sources that bring us into greater depth. Also feel free to bring in other this from other sources especially those representing different voices from different countries.)"

We also want to have a useful data set for each case that includes further information such as the final decision, the votes of each justice, who wrote the decision (and perhaps the dissenting opinion too). It is up to you what should ultimately be included and how we will be able to search through the data and view results.\n",
    "\n",

Although you can certainly try to come up with a more creative way of mapping the cases. Or you can choose not to map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation of cases (headline and article) is a much more interpretive one, the recommended approach would be to come up with categories for the types of cases--what is that stake for each case.\n",

This central challenge is figuring out how to categorize and analyze a year worth of arguments before the Supreme Court. You will rely mainly on speaker, word frequency, specific word searches, and your own reading of some or all of the texts yourself. (The map is not a particularly useful framework for this project--therefore most of the important work will be conceptual and behind the scenes. This project will allow you to contend with the challenges text analysis.)"

While those shortcuts might be appealing, see how much you can get from these primary resources. From a journalistic standpoint, Wikipedia should be the last resort--and do understand that their data frames reflect their choices of what's important. That said, for all of these projects, you may find outside sources in whatever format you wish, and use them to enhance your data--just be mindful of their reliability."

Actually tracking and obtaining the campaign stops and speeches for each of these candidates is quite challenging.

BRYN\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\\n\\n\\n10 it please the Court:\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nSince the invalidation of the residual\\n\\n\\n12 clause in 2015, the only way for a state\\n\\n\\n13 robbery offense to qualify as an ACCA violent\\n\\n\\n14 felony is if it has violent force as an\\n\\n\\n15 element. Florida robbery does not have that\\n\\n\\n16 element because it requires only slight force\\n\\n\\n17 to overcome slight victim resistance.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your -- your\\n\\n\\n19 position is no robbery conviction in Florida\\n\\n\\n20 counts under the Armed Career Criminal offense?\\n\\n\\n21 A robbery in Florida is out entirely?\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Because of the categorical\\n\\n\\n23 approach. Because the least culpable conduct\\n\\n\\n24 for robbery in Florida does not require violent\\n\\n\\n25 force.\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n1\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'m sorry. Does\\n\\n\\n2 that apply -- your answer apply to the armed\\n\\n\\n3 robbery subsections of the Florida statute?\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nMS. BRYN: In the Florida statute,\\n\\n\\n5 yes, because armed robbery in Florida does not\\n\\n\\n6 require using or brandishing or displaying or\\n\\n\\n7 even representing that one has a weapon. It\\n\\n\\n8 only requires carrying.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nBut in most states that have armed\\n\\n\\n10 robbery, aggravated robbery offenses that\\n\\n\\n11 require using, displaying, threatening a\\n\\n\\n12 weapon, those offenses would qualify because\\n\\n\\n13 that\\'s a threatened use of violent force.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nFlorida juries are instructed every\\n\\n\\n15 day in Florida that although resistance is\\n\\n\\n16 required, no particular degree of resistance is\\n\\n\\n17 required. A victim can resist to any\\n\\n\\n18 particular extent, and, in fact, the case law\\n\\n\\n19 in Florida confirms that resistance sufficient\\n\\n\\n20 for a robbery conviction and a penalty up to 15\\n\\n\\n21 years in the state penitentiary can involve\\n\\n\\n22 nothing more than the tightening of one\\'s hand\\n\\n\\n23 momentarily on a dollar bill before releasing\\n\\n\\n24 it.\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I actually\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n1 tried that, holding, since I knew this was -\\n\\n2 this was your most -- this was your most\\n\\n\\n3 important case, and I held on to a dollar bill\\n\\n\\n4 and asked each of my law clerks to try to pull\\n\\n\\n5 it out of my hand. And I was surprised. I\\n\\n\\n6 mean, people think, oh, it tears easily. Well,\\n\\n\\n7 it tears easily if you go like this, but if\\n\\n\\n8 you\\'re really tugging on it -- I mean, it\\'s -\\n\\n9 I\\'m not saying nobody could do it, but -- but\\n\\n\\n10 it requires -\\n\\n11\\n\\n(Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a lot of\\n\\n\\n13 force, more than you might think.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nMS. BRYN: I don\\'t think, Your Honor,\\n\\n\\n15 that it requires a substantial degree of force\\n\\n\\n16 as this Court defined that in Curtis Johnson\\n\\n\\n17 using the adjectives, all of which connote\\n\\n\\n18 actual violence, which are severe force,\\n\\n\\n19 extreme, furious, vehement, strong, and\\n\\n\\n20 powerful force.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nClearly, there is some force involved.\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it also\\n\\n\\n23 said -- it also said -- and this, of course, is\\n\\n\\n24 the language your friend on the other side\\n\\n\\n25 stresses -- capable of causing physical pain or\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n1 injury. You know, that covers a broader area\\n\\n\\n2 than some of the other adjectives that were in\\n\\n\\n3 the same paragraph.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nMS. BRYN: The -- the phrase \"force\\n\\n\\n5 capable of causing pain or injury\" has to be\\n\\n\\n6 understood in context, and it is explaining\\n\\n\\n7 violent force in the context of a violent\\n\\n\\n8 felony definition.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nThe Court emphasized the word\\n\\n\\n10 \"violence\" by italicizing it, and then the\\n\\n\\n11 Court gave all of these ordinary dictionary\\n\\n\\n12 definitions of \"violence\" or \"violent\" which\\n\\n\\n13 are extreme force, vehement, furious force.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nSo I -\\n\\n15\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that -\\n\\n16 do you think that shoving, grabbing, and\\n\\n\\n17 pinching count as physical force under ACCA?\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Your Honor, the\\n\\n\\n19 determination under ACCA cannot be made in a\\n\\n\\n20 vacuum. So there\\'s no -- there\\'s no category\\n\\n\\n21 of conduct, I guess we can say, besides\\n\\n\\n22 stabbing someone in the back directly would\\n\\n\\n23 involve that.\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nMost conduct has to be viewed in\\n\\n\\n25 context. For instance, the Court gave the\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n1 example in ACCA of a slap to the face. In\\n\\n\\n2 Castleman, they gave the example of a squeeze\\n\\n\\n3 to the arm. So you have to look beyond the\\n\\n\\n4 actual category.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nAnd one very powerful -\\n\\n6\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought under\\n\\n\\n7 the categorical approach, you have to look at\\n\\n\\n8 the category. So I really don\\'t understand why\\n\\n\\n9 you can\\'t answer that question.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Well, they have -\\n\\n11\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does pinching, for\\n\\n\\n12 example, constitute physical force sufficient\\n\\n\\n13 to -- to activate ACCA?\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nMS. BRYN: The categorical approach\\n\\n\\n15 actually does not require you to look at a\\n\\n\\n16 category. It requires you to look at the\\n\\n\\n17 actual cases and determine what the least\\n\\n\\n18 culpable conduct for a conviction, and that\\n\\n\\n19 conduct does not exist in a vacuum.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'m sorry, we used\\n\\n\\n21 the example of a tap on the shoulder not being\\n\\n\\n22 sufficient force. So can you answer Justice\\n\\n\\n23 Alito\\'s hypothetical?\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Right.\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is a pinch, an\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n1 ordinary pinch -- let\\'s not talk about an\\n\\n\\n2 extraordinary -\\n\\n3\\n\\n(Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- pulling of the\\n\\n\\n5 ears that a parent might sometimes do. Let\\'s\\n\\n\\n6 talk about just a pinch.\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n(Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that sufficient\\n\\n\\n9 force? If we said a tap on the shoulder\\n\\n\\n10 couldn\\'t be, why could a pinch be?\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nMS. BRYN: I -- I think the -- the\\n\\n\\n12 answer is looking at the -- the other side of\\n\\n\\n13 the equation from what a substantial degree of\\n\\n\\n14 force is. And Your Honor mentioned force\\n\\n\\n15 capable of -- of causing pain or injury. And I\\n\\n\\n16 think the only way to read that explanation of\\n\\n\\n17 violent force is as force that\\'s -- a degree of\\n\\n\\n18 force that\\'s reasonably expected to cause pain\\n\\n\\n19 or injury.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You\\'ve -\\n\\n21\\n\\nMS. BRYN: I don\\'t think a pinch -\\n\\n22\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you\\'ve said the\\n\\n\\n23 reasonable -- and I do understand your point,\\n\\n\\n24 which is, from personal experience, if you tap\\n\\n\\n25 an injured shoulder, it could cause injury.\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n1 It\\'s capable of causing physical pain and\\n\\n\\n2 injury.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nBut we said, in the normal course of\\n\\n\\n4 circumstances, a tap on the shoulder would not\\n\\n\\n5 -- is not capable of producing injury. So -\\n\\n6\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Nor would a pinch.\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'m sorry? What?\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Nor would a pinch in normal\\n\\n\\n9 circumstances.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that\\'s the\\n\\n\\n11 point. So I know you use \"reasonably\\n\\n\\n12 expected,\" but is it reasonably expected or\\n\\n\\n13 just simply capable in -- in -- in the normal\\n\\n\\n14 course to -\\n\\n15\\n\\nMS. BRYN: The -- the reason that we\\n\\n\\n16 have articulated reasonably expected is to\\n\\n\\n17 contrast with an outlier case. And as Your\\n\\n\\n18 Honor mentioned, a tap can cause pain or injury\\n\\n\\n19 if you have an injured shoulder, if the victim\\n\\n\\n20 has some unique susceptibility to pain. So\\n\\n\\n21 that\\'s why it is difficult to talk about\\n\\n\\n22 categories, and you have to look at the\\n\\n\\n23 circumstances. But the circumstances are the\\n\\n\\n24 normal ones, as Your Honor -\\n\\n25\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, this has -\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n1\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Bryn, I wonder if\\n\\n\\n2 you could say a bit more about this reasonable\\n\\n\\n3 expectation standard, because I\\'m not sure it\\n\\n\\n4 does all that much that\\'s different from what\\n\\n\\n5 the government\\'s standard does.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nI mean, if you take something like\\n\\n\\n7 grabbing money out of a hand and say could that\\n\\n\\n8 reasonably be expected to cause pain or injury,\\n\\n\\n9 well, maybe some injury, maybe a bruise, maybe\\n\\n\\n10 a little scratch, maybe a little cut.\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nAnd, similarly, even a pinch. I mean,\\n\\n\\n12 reasonably expected to cause pain? Sure, for a\\n\\n\\n13 while, for a moment. So how does your standard\\n\\n\\n14 really help to distinguish the kinds of cases\\n\\n\\n15 that you want to distinguish?\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Because I think the\\n\\n\\n17 categorical approach requires you to look at\\n\\n\\n18 real cases, and our real cases involve this\\n\\n\\n19 minimal pulling or tugging action that resulted\\n\\n\\n20 in no pain or injury. And that\\'s a very\\n\\n\\n21 powerful -\\n\\n22\\n\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that could\\n\\n\\n23 be in a particular case, but don\\'t you have to\\n\\n\\n24 take the conduct in -- in general? And\\n\\n\\n25 particularly Justice Alito\\'s question about\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n1 pinching, there are some people who have thin\\n\\n\\n2 skin and bruise very easily, and a pinch would\\n\\n\\n3 probably be sufficient to cause bruising,\\n\\n\\n4 actual injury.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Right. So that would not\\n\\n\\n6 be a circumstance known to the perpetrator.\\n\\n\\n7 And the test that the Court set forth in Curtis\\n\\n\\n8 Johnson by specifying over and over again that\\n\\n\\n9 it\\'s a degree of force, and the Court used the\\n\\n\\n10 word \"degree\" four separate times, is a test\\n\\n\\n11 that is focused on the perpetrator, not on the\\n\\n\\n12 victim.\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nI mean, we -- we all know from first\\n\\n\\n14 year of law school that there are eggshell\\n\\n\\n15 plaintiffs. And the purpose of ACCA is to\\n\\n\\n16 predict future violence with a gun for people\\n\\n\\n17 who possess a gun, who would be the people that\\n\\n\\n18 would be willing to pull a trigger and kill\\n\\n\\n19 someone.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nSo, if there is an incidental injury,\\n\\n\\n21 an accidental injury that no one could have\\n\\n\\n22 imagined because someone does have thin skin or\\n\\n\\n23 someone has just had shoulder surgery or has a\\n\\n\\n24 tender area of their body, it would -\\n\\n25\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But my question wasn\\'t\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n1 that. It wasn\\'t the eggshell plaintiff. It\\n\\n\\n2 was the ordinary person who can reasonably be\\n\\n\\n3 expected to suffer some, even if minimal, pain\\n\\n\\n4 or injury, the pain that a pinch causes or the\\n\\n\\n5 injury that comes from your hand being bruised\\n\\n\\n6 when somebody tries to grab some cash out of\\n\\n\\n7 it.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nAnd I guess I was -- I was confused\\n\\n\\n9 that you wanted to use this standard,\\n\\n\\n10 \"reasonably be expected to cause pain or\\n\\n\\n11 injury,\" because it does seem to me as though a\\n\\n\\n12 lot of minor activity could -- could satisfy\\n\\n\\n13 that standard.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nMS. BRYN: So that\\'s why we -- we have\\n\\n\\n15 said, number one, that whether there is an\\n\\n\\n16 actual pain or injury in the actual reported\\n\\n\\n17 cases, what has been prosecuted by the state?\\n\\n\\n18 Has the state prosecuted for no injury or for\\n\\n\\n19 exceedingly minor injuries? In Florida, they\\n\\n\\n20 prosecute for no injury.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nSo even though it is possible to\\n\\n\\n22 hypothesize a case where the same conduct might\\n\\n\\n23 cause injury, I mean, we think those are\\n\\n\\n24 outlier cases because the real cases that\\n\\n\\n25 resulted in prosecution in our state have not\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n1 resulted in injury.\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how -\\n\\n3\\n\\nMS. BRYN: We\\'re not saying it can\\n\\n\\n4 never happen.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how -- how then\\n\\n\\n6 would you -- you -- would you describe an ACCA\\n\\n\\n7 qualifying physical force? Can you give us\\n\\n\\n8 your definition?\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Yes. It\\'s a degree of\\n\\n\\n10 force that is substantial enough to be\\n\\n\\n11 reasonably expected to cause pain or injury in\\n\\n\\n12 most cases, rather than an outlier case.\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nAnd in -- in determining whether the\\n\\n\\n14 offenses under our statute match that, a\\n\\n\\n15 powerful circumstance is if the conduct has not\\n\\n\\n16 resulted in any pain or injury.\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: In Taylor, the Court\\n\\n\\n18 said that the revision of ACCA to include the\\n\\n\\n19 elements clause expanded the predicate offenses\\n\\n\\n20 beyond just robbery and burglary.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nBut we are told that your reading of\\n\\n\\n22 the statute would knock out robbery offenses in\\n\\n\\n23 30 to 40 case -- in 30 to 40 states.\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nWhat is your response to that? Does\\n\\n\\n25 that seem -- does it seem likely that that\\'s\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n1 what Congress was intending to do?\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Well, there -- there are\\n\\n\\n3 two parts of that question. Congress intended\\n\\n\\n4 to cover robbery in the expansion, robbery and\\n\\n\\n5 additional crimes. The way it sought to do\\n\\n\\n6 that was by writing two different violent\\n\\n\\n7 felony definitions.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nOne was very narrow and circumscribed.\\n\\n\\n9 That\\'s the elements clause. The other one was\\n\\n\\n10 quite expansive, capacious, and would sweep in\\n\\n\\n11 every type of robbery, even snatchings, even\\n\\n\\n12 not -- robberies, pickpocketings, theft\\n\\n\\n13 offenses that require no force whatsoever.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: So your answer -- your\\n\\n\\n15 answer is that they thought that robbery was\\n\\n\\n16 going to be covered by the residual clause, is\\n\\n\\n17 that right?\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nMS. BRYN: They wrote language that\\n\\n\\n19 would have covered it under the residual\\n\\n\\n20 clause. And it did until three years ago.\\n\\n\\n21 This issue did not really come before the\\n\\n\\n22 Court.\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: Counsel, I\\'m stuck\\n\\n\\n24 there too, because if Congress uses the word\\n\\n\\n25 robbery, we wouldn\\'t normally think that it\\'s\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n1 excluding more than half the states\\' statutes\\n\\n\\n2 that are defining robbery.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nThat -- that -- that just seems like a\\n\\n\\n4 strike against the statutory reading you\\'re\\n\\n\\n5 asking us to adopt. And -- and I understand\\n\\n\\n6 there\\'s the residual clause, but Congress used\\n\\n\\n7 the term \"robbery\" -\\n\\n8\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Well, it -\\n\\n9\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: -- and we\\'ve said it\\n\\n\\n10 used it in the ordinary sense at the time of\\n\\n\\n11 adoption. And at the time of adoption, it\\n\\n\\n12 appears that, as Justice Alito suggested, over\\n\\n\\n13 half the states would have included this kind\\n\\n\\n14 of conduct.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Well, again, two answers to\\n\\n\\n16 that question. It used \"robbery\" in the \\'84\\n\\n\\n17 Act and it deleted \"robbery\" in the \\'86 Act at\\n\\n\\n18 the same time that it continued to enumerate\\n\\n\\n19 burglary.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nTo capture the robberies, Congress had\\n\\n\\n21 two different definitions. And as to whether\\n\\n\\n22 43 states would be knocked out by our\\n\\n\\n23 definition, as we have said in our reply brief\\n\\n\\n24 and demonstrated in our appendix, the\\n\\n\\n25 government has only matched words in the\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n1 statute, the word \"force\" and the word\\n\\n\\n2 \"resistance.\"\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nIt has not done what the categorical\\n\\n\\n4 approach requires, which is to take a deep dive\\n\\n\\n5 into state law.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how many states\\n\\n\\n7 do you think -\\n\\n8\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don\\'t understand\\n\\n9 your -\\n\\n10\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- how many states do\\n\\n11 you think will be knocked out? Because, I\\n\\n\\n12 mean, Florida seems as though it\\'s out of luck\\n\\n\\n13 because both -- it can\\'t pick up under armed\\n\\n\\n14 robbery what it loses under unarmed robbery for\\n\\n\\n15 the reason that you said earlier.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nPresumably, there are other states in\\n\\n\\n17 which armed robbery would count as -- as a -\\n\\n18 as -- as under the -- this clause. So how many\\n\\n\\n19 states do you think are going to be in\\n\\n\\n20 Florida\\'s position that none of their robbery\\n\\n\\n21 statutes count under this clause?\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nMS. BRYN: I -- I would say four or\\n\\n\\n23 less.\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Four or less?\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nMS. BRYN: I would say four or less -\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n1\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why is that?\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nMS. BRYN: -- would have no form of\\n\\n\\n3 robbery because there are, first of all, just\\n\\n\\n4 from my review, and I\\'m not an authority on\\n\\n\\n5 every state, but from my review, there are not\\n\\n\\n6 many states that have the trifecta that Florida\\n\\n\\n7 has.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nAnd let me say what that is. It is\\n\\n\\n9 quite unique. And that is explicit embracing\\n\\n\\n10 of any degree of resistance, number one.\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nNumber two, embracing the principle\\n\\n\\n12 that any degree of force can overcome any\\n\\n\\n13 degree of resistance.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nAnd, third, actual prosecutions for\\n\\n\\n15 slight force robberies. Some states embrace\\n\\n\\n16 the immateriality principle. There are some\\n\\n\\n17 states that have one or two applications. But\\n\\n\\n18 there are very few states that I have seen in\\n\\n\\n19 my research that are like Florida in having\\n\\n\\n20 everything.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nAnd then, on top of it, there are very\\n\\n\\n22 few states that would be like Florida that also\\n\\n\\n23 don\\'t have an armed robbery provision that\\n\\n\\n24 involves use, display, threat of a weapon.\\n\\n\\n25 We\\'ve listed those in our appendix.\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n1\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in how many\\n\\n\\n2 states would common law robbery, would simple\\n\\n\\n3 robbery, not armed robbery or an aggravated\\n\\n\\n4 form of robbery, be knocked out by your\\n\\n\\n5 understanding of the statute?\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nMS. BRYN: So, again, it -- it\\'s -\\n\\n7 it\\'s hard to give an actual number. And we see\\n\\n\\n8 from the -- the mistakes that were made in the\\n\\n\\n9 government\\'s appendix, that\\'s really a fraught\\n\\n\\n10 inquiry, but what I would suggest is that it\\'s\\n\\n\\n11 really only a handful, maybe six states or\\n\\n\\n12 less, that are like Florida in having\\n\\n\\n13 everything, the principles and the\\n\\n\\n14 applications. There are a few others that\\n\\n\\n15 state the principles broadly, but there are no\\n\\n\\n16 applications. And a few others that have\\n\\n\\n17 slight force applications.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you think that in\\n\\n\\n19 -- in applying the categorical approach here,\\n\\n\\n20 it\\'s necessary to look to the cases that are\\n\\n\\n21 prosecuted?\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Yes, I think -\\n\\n23\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: To -- you have to look\\n\\n\\n24 to -- to -- beyond the statute, you have to\\n\\n\\n25 look to prosecutorial policies and practices?\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n1\\n\\nMS. BRYN: That -- that\\'s what the\\n\\n\\n2 Court said in Duenas-Alvarez, to determine if a\\n\\n\\n3 statute can be or has been applied to\\n\\n\\n4 non-violent, non-generic conduct or in an\\n\\n\\n5 overbroad way. The only way you can know that\\n\\n\\n6 is to find actual cases. And that\\'s -\\n\\n7\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, even if the\\n\\n\\n8 statute on its face includes that kind of\\n\\n\\n9 conduct?\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMS. BRYN: The statute -- well, first\\n\\n\\n11 of all, the Florida statute on its face does\\n\\n\\n12 not even include resistance. That\\'s been\\n\\n\\n13 judicially implied, and that\\'s the fact in some\\n\\n\\n14 states as well.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nBut let\\'s say there\\'s a statute that\\n\\n\\n16 uses the term \"resistance\" or overcoming\\n\\n\\n17 resistance and force.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nStill, what the Court said in Curtis\\n\\n\\n19 Johnson is that this Court, federal courts,\\n\\n\\n20 have to defer to the state\\'s interpretation of\\n\\n\\n21 their elements.\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nIn our appendix, we cited a Michigan\\n\\n\\n23 case that -- that -- the statute uses the term\\n\\n\\n24 violence, and there is a case in Michigan that\\n\\n\\n25 says spitting is sufficient violence for the\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n1 statute. I mean, that\\'s Curtis Johnson,\\n\\n\\n2 touching, contact behavior.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nAt the other side of the spectrum, we\\n\\n\\n4 have common law robbery states that say there\\n\\n\\n5 are no minimal force applications. Our state\\n\\n\\n6 Supreme Court has never said that the degree of\\n\\n\\n7 force is immaterial. South Carolina, for\\n\\n\\n8 example. And the Fourth Circuit said that in\\n\\n\\n9 Doctor. And that\\'s a common law robbery state.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nAnd they said it qualifies because\\n\\n\\n11 there are no -- no broad principles embraced by\\n\\n\\n12 this Court which would suggest slight force can\\n\\n\\n13 qualify, nor are there any applications.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nSo, under the categorical approach, it\\n\\n\\n15 will be a state-by-state inquiry, but all of\\n\\n\\n16 the circuit court of appeals know how to do it.\\n\\n\\n17 They\\'ve been doing it since Taylor. And they\\n\\n\\n18 have to examine each state\\'s law.\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\nI -- I have exhaustively reviewed\\n\\n\\n20 Florida law, and I have looked at other states\\'\\n\\n\\n21 law, and I can tell you that not many states\\n\\n\\n22 are like Florida in having everything.\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: Counsel, let\\'s say\\n\\n\\n24 we -- we disagree with your understanding of\\n\\n\\n25 Duenas, and we think that if it\\'s clear on the\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n1 face of a statute that conduct is encompassed.\\n\\n\\n2 Under the elements approach in Taylor, then\\n\\n\\n3 that\\'s how we would define it.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nDoes that alter the number of states\\n\\n\\n5 that you think would be knocked out under your\\n\\n\\n6 approach?\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Well, I\\'ve already knocked\\n\\n\\n8 out, I -- I believe, at least 10 states on -\\n\\n9 in my approach by reporting in our appendix the\\n\\n\\n10 full language of the statute that the\\n\\n\\n11 government excerpted out of its own appendix.\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nSo statutes which make clear on the\\n\\n\\n13 face of the statute that violence can be\\n\\n\\n14 contact. Mere touching, any impact.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nSo, yes, that reduces the number.\\n\\n\\n16 But, other than that, once we are down to\\n\\n\\n17 force, violence, and resistance, those are\\n\\n\\n18 common words that come from the common law, but\\n\\n\\n19 each state has gone in its own direction.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nAnd in order to properly do the\\n\\n\\n21 categorical approach under the elements clause,\\n\\n\\n22 you have to defer to the interpretation of\\n\\n\\n23 those elements.\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nIt\\'s a different type of inquiry than\\n\\n\\n25 for the generic offense determination. Some\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n1 generic offense determinations can be made on\\n\\n\\n2 the face of the statute because the statutory\\n\\n\\n3 language is plain, but, as we have shown by\\n\\n\\n4 case law showing that resistance can be nothing\\n\\n\\n5 more than the momentary tightening of one\\'s\\n\\n\\n6 hand, that the word \"resistance\" does not have\\n\\n\\n7 a meaning in and of itself.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: But -- but,\\n\\n\\n9 counsel -- counsel, in Curtis Johnson, you rely\\n\\n\\n10 heavily on the general statements of the Court,\\n\\n\\n11 but the application of those general statements\\n\\n\\n12 was to something very specific: battery and a\\n\\n\\n13 mere tap on the shoulder. And all Curtis\\n\\n\\n14 Johnson seemed to hold was that that was\\n\\n\\n15 excluded.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nSo why don\\'t we follow what Curtis\\n\\n\\n17 Johnson seemed to do in applying those general\\n\\n\\n18 statements to the specific statute at issue\\n\\n\\n19 here, and why wouldn\\'t that then encompass the\\n\\n\\n20 Florida statute, which requires more than, say,\\n\\n\\n21 a tap on the shoulder?\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Because what the Court did\\n\\n\\n23 before applying the standard to the statute -\\n\\n24 to the Florida battery statute was to\\n\\n\\n25 definitively construe the words that -\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\n1\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Well, but it -\\n\\n2 but it\\'s -\\n\\n3\\n\\nMS. BRYN: -- Congress used in the\\n\\n\\n4 elements clause.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: But it -- as you\\n\\n\\n7 point out, it\\'s -- it\\'s a bit general, those\\n\\n\\n8 statements, that language. And so how do we\\n\\n\\n9 understand what the Court meant by that? You\\n\\n\\n10 look at how it applied it, and it was to a\\n\\n\\n11 battery statute, and it was a case where the\\n\\n\\n12 government argued that the mere tap on the\\n\\n\\n13 shoulder was okay. And the Court said no,\\n\\n\\n14 that\\'s not enough. But all it seemed to carve\\n\\n\\n15 out was that kind of statute. At least as I\\n\\n\\n16 read page 139 of the Curtis Johnson opinion, it\\n\\n\\n17 seemed to very carefully distinguish those two\\n\\n\\n18 situations.\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Your -- Your Honor, I -- I\\n\\n\\n20 disagree with that, because I believe that the\\n\\n\\n21 standard the -- the Court set forth was a\\n\\n\\n22 violent felony definition. The Court said that\\n\\n\\n23 the word \"violent\" alone connotes a substantial\\n\\n\\n24 degree of force, and used words like \"severe,\"\\n\\n\\n25 \"extreme,\" \"vehement,\" \"furious\" to\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\n1 characterize and flesh out the concept of what\\n\\n\\n2 a substantial degree of force is.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nAnd the conduct in our case, yes, it\\'s\\n\\n\\n4 more than a mere touching, but it\\'s not\\n\\n\\n5 extreme, furious, severe, vehement, any -- any\\n\\n\\n6 of the adjectives, the ordinary dictionary\\n\\n\\n7 terms, which -- which was the definition of\\n\\n\\n8 \"violent force\" the Court embraced in -- in\\n\\n\\n9 rejecting the common law view.\\n\\n10\\n\\nSo the Court did not draw a line. It\\n\\n11 would have been a very short opinion if\\n\\n12 touching is out and everything else is in. And\\n\\n13 we see from Castleman four years later that\\n\\n\\n14 other minor uses of force do not convey the\\n\\n\\n15 sense of violence in the -- the colloquial\\n\\n\\n16 sense, and the Court reinforced that in\\n\\n\\n17 Castleman.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nSo I think there\\'s a lot more in the\\n\\n\\n19 definition of Curtis Johnson. The standard was\\n\\n\\n20 a substantial degree. The Court gave\\n\\n\\n21 adjectives that meet it, and the conduct in\\n\\n\\n22 several of the Florida cases does not amount to\\n\\n\\n23 that level. And that\\'s why Florida robbery\\n\\n\\n24 does not qualify.\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the statutory term\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\n1 is physical force.\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Right.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: And in the ordinary\\n\\n\\n4 understanding of that, force sufficient to\\n\\n\\n5 overcome resistance would be physical force.\\n\\n\\n6 The holding in Curtis Johnson was what Justice\\n\\n\\n7 Kavanaugh described, battery -- the touching\\n\\n\\n8 that is necessary for a battery is not physical\\n\\n\\n9 force; any unwanted touching satisfies common\\n\\n\\n10 law battery.\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nNow, if we go beyond that, you have -\\n\\n12 it would be necessary to quantify the degree of\\n\\n\\n13 physical force that\\'s required, like how many\\n\\n\\n14 pounds per square inch. I have no idea how you\\n\\n\\n15 do that.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nMS. BRYN: The -- the standard that\\n\\n\\n17 the Court set in Curtis Johnson, I believe, is\\n\\n\\n18 a substantial degree in force and as -\\n\\n19\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: So what is a\\n\\n\\n20 substantial degree of force?\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nMS. BRYN: So the -- as the Chief\\n\\n\\n22 Justice stated in -- most recently in Dimaya,\\n\\n\\n23 that substantial standards are found all\\n\\n\\n24 through the law. \"Substantial\" is a familiar\\n\\n\\n25 term. Judge -\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n1\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many votes\\n\\n2 did that get in Dimaya?\\n\\n3\\n\\n(Laughter.)\\n\\n4\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not five.\\n\\n5\\n\\n(Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nMS. BRYN: The -- the majority in\\n\\n\\n7 Dimaya -\\n\\n8\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The majority agreed\\n\\n\\n9 with that point.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Yes, the majority in Dimaya\\n\\n\\n11 actually said that \"substantial\" is not a\\n\\n\\n12 difficult term to apply at all when it\\'s being\\n\\n\\n13 applied to real-world conduct. And that\\'s what\\n\\n\\n14 the categorical approach requires. We have\\n\\n\\n15 real cases. Apply the term \"substantial\" to\\n\\n\\n16 real-world cases.\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nAnd one important factor in our\\n\\n\\n18 real-world cases, our prosecutions, is whether\\n\\n\\n19 there was pain or injury in -- in the actual\\n\\n\\n20 case. We have cases that -\\n\\n21\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you think\\n\\n\\n22 there could not be substantial force unless it\\n\\n\\n23 actually causes pain or injury?\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nMS. BRYN: No, I\\'m not -- I\\'m not\\n\\n\\n25 saying that either. And -- and I think we said\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n27\\n\\n1 that in our brief. It\\'s -- it\\'s -- that\\'s a\\n\\n\\n2 significant circumstance, like circumstantial\\n\\n\\n3 evidence.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nThere could be someone who is uniquely\\n\\n\\n5 immune to pain. I mean, if you\\'re pinching\\n\\n\\n6 Arnold Schwarzenegger or slapping him or\\n\\n\\n7 something else -\\n\\n8\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you think this\\n\\n\\n9 depends on a case-by-case determination?\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMS. BRYN: No. I think it depends on\\n\\n\\n11 judges using their common sense and common\\n\\n\\n12 experience that they use every day under the\\n\\n\\n13 guidelines to make determinations of degree,\\n\\n\\n14 determining what\\'s minor, what\\'s major. This\\n\\n\\n15 -- this is what judging is. This is what\\n\\n\\n16 juries do.\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you -- you have to\\n\\n\\n18 hypothesize a particular type of robber and a\\n\\n\\n19 particular type of victim. So, you know, what\\n\\n\\n20 is the -- what is the quintessential robber and\\n\\n\\n21 what is the quintessential victim?\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nAs you -- you know, as you just\\n\\n\\n23 mentioned, if you have a very strong victim and\\n\\n\\n24 a very weak robber, an awful lot of force could\\n\\n\\n25 be applied without a reasonable possibility of\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\n1 causing pain. On the other hand, in what might\\n\\n\\n2 be the more typical situation, if you have a\\n\\n\\n3 young, strong robber who pulls a purse out of\\n\\n\\n4 the hands of an elderly woman or a briefcase\\n\\n\\n5 out of the hands of an elderly man, there\\'s a\\n\\n\\n6 real chance that that\\'s going to cause pain and\\n\\n\\n7 maybe serious physical injury.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Well -\\n\\n9\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: So I have no idea how\\n\\n\\n10 to imagine that the -- the typical robber and\\n\\n\\n11 the typical victim.\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Well, I can\\'t -\\n\\n13\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Who are these people?\\n\\n\\n14 Can you describe them for me?\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nMS. BRYN: I -- I don\\'t think that our\\n\\n\\n16 test or the standard requires imagining a\\n\\n\\n17 typical victim. It requires, under the\\n\\n\\n18 categorical approach, to look at the actual\\n\\n\\n19 cases.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nOur cases did involve, to -- to use\\n\\n\\n21 your language, typical victims.\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Under your -\\n\\n23 under the cases -- under the Florida cases,\\n\\n\\n24 you\\'ve studied them all, what is the typical\\n\\n\\n25 victim and what is the typical robber?\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n1\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Someone that doesn\\'t have\\n\\n\\n2 any of those unique characteristics that you\\n\\n\\n3 just described. They were not particularly\\n\\n\\n4 weak, frail, any -- anything that would have\\n\\n\\n5 been obvious.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nAnd -- and let me just stress this:\\n\\n\\n7 The encounters in the Florida cases took place\\n\\n\\n8 in a split second. They were momentary,\\n\\n\\n9 one-handed, tearing -- tearing something out of\\n\\n\\n10 another person\\'s hand with one hand. Maybe if\\n\\n\\n11 you use two hands and grab someone by the arm\\n\\n\\n12 and pull at the same time, that\\'s a different\\n\\n\\n13 degree of force.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nBut doing it one-handed in a momentary\\n\\n\\n15 encounter like this, I -- I think in everyone\\'s\\n\\n\\n16 common experience, judges and juries would be\\n\\n\\n17 able to say that is not a substantial degree of\\n\\n\\n18 force. That\\'s not like slapping someone in the\\n\\n\\n19 face. That\\'s not like stabbing someone in the\\n\\n\\n20 back or those type of facts.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nI -- I -- I don\\'t think that\\'s\\n\\n\\n22 difficult. It may be a more difficult\\n\\n\\n23 determination where the least culpable conduct\\n\\n\\n24 in a state involves substantial injury because\\n\\n\\n25 there was some sort of vulnerability of the\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\n1 victim, but that\\'s not Florida. So that -\\n\\n2 that would be a different case.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nBut what we know from Florida is that\\n\\n\\n4 any degree of resistance and any degree of\\n\\n\\n5 force -- I see that I have my light. I\\'d like\\n\\n\\n6 to reserve my retaining time for rebuttal.\\n\\n\\n7 Thank you.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\\n\\n\\n9 counsel.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMr. Liu.\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nMR. LIU: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\\n\\n\\n14 it please the Court:\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nFor centuries, the common law has\\n\\n\\n16 provided a basis to distinguish violent takings\\n\\n\\n17 of property from non-violent takings. Violent\\n\\n\\n18 takings or robberies were takings that involved\\n\\n\\n19 the use of force sufficient to overcome the\\n\\n\\n20 victim\\'s resistance.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nThat\\'s the element of force that\\'s\\n\\n\\n22 found in the robbery -- basic robbery statutes\\n\\n\\n23 of over 40 states, including Florida. It\\'s the\\n\\n\\n24 element of force that Congress used in its own\\n\\n\\n25 definition of robbery in the original 1984\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\n1 ACCA.\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nAnd when Congress amended the ACCA two\\n\\n\\n3 years later, it took that element and made it\\n\\n\\n4 the centerpiece of the new elements clause.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nUnder Petitioner\\'s interpretation of\\n\\n\\n6 the ACCA, however, common law robbery would not\\n\\n\\n7 qualify as an ACCA predicate.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nIn fact, Petitioner cannot identify a\\n\\n\\n9 single state whose basic robbery statute,\\n\\n\\n10 whether based on the common law or not, would\\n\\n\\n11 qualify under his interpretation.\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. -- Mr. Liu, could\\n\\n\\n13 I just ask what you understand the Florida\\n\\n\\n14 cases to be saying? So I\\'ll give you a hypo to\\n\\n\\n15 elucidate that.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nSo I\\'m walking down the street and I\\'m\\n\\n\\n17 carrying a handbag with a strap over my\\n\\n\\n18 shoulder, and, as everybody knows, the way you\\n\\n\\n19 carry that is you essentially grab on to the\\n\\n\\n20 strap. So -- and then somebody comes and runs\\n\\n\\n21 and wrests it out of my grasp.\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nDoes that count under Florida law as\\n\\n\\n23 robbery?\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nMR. LIU: It -- it depends. I think\\n\\n\\n25 it would depend on a few more facts, but I\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n32\\n\\n1 think -- I think the Florida cases do focus\\n\\n\\n2 just on this issue. And if I -- if I could\\n\\n\\n3 illustrate my answer with a couple of the\\n\\n\\n4 Florida cases.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, I want -- well,\\n\\n\\n6 you can illustrate it, sure -\\n\\n7\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, I -- I think the -\\n\\n8\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- but, I mean, I want\\n\\n\\n9 an answer to my hypothetical.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMR. LIU: -- I think the facts you\\n\\n\\n11 described are not too different from the facts\\n\\n\\n12 of Rigell, and I think that is a case where the\\n\\n\\n13 Florida courts did conclude that the force used\\n\\n\\n14 was sufficient.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nThere, the -- the -- the victim had a\\n\\n\\n16 bag on his shoulder -- on her shoulder. The\\n\\n\\n17 victim -- the defendant came around, yanked the\\n\\n\\n18 bag off. There was a bit of a struggle because\\n\\n\\n19 the -- the victim turned and tried to resist in\\n\\n\\n20 that fashion.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah, so -\\n\\n22\\n\\nMR. LIU: And the purse -- the strap\\n\\n\\n23 of the purse -\\n\\n24\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- I was actually\\n\\n\\n25 taking that out, because, you know, I\\'m -- I\\'m\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n33\\n\\n1 -- I\\'m holding on to the bag, so you\\'re going\\n\\n\\n2 to need some force to get it. But -- and -\\n\\n3 and that kind of force is used. Robbery?\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nMR. LIU: Yes.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Well, then\\n\\n\\n6 robbery in Florida really includes pretty much\\n\\n\\n7 the full gamut of bag snatchings.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nMR. LIU: I don\\'t -- I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n\\n9 And I\\'ll give you a case that illustrates that.\\n\\n\\n10 A case called RP, which is cited in the\\n\\n\\n11 Robinson case -- that\\'s sort of the seminal\\n\\n\\n12 case -- involves someone who grabbed a camera\\n\\n\\n13 that was hanging off someone\\'s shoulder, and\\n\\n\\n14 that did not rise to the -- to the level of\\n\\n\\n15 force necessary for robbery.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nAnd the difference between the two\\n\\n\\n17 cases is the added element of violence. It is\\n\\n\\n18 the resistance by the victim.\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Right. All I was\\n\\n\\n20 saying, I mean, I\\'m sure you can find me a\\n\\n\\n21 couple of cases where people walk around with\\n\\n\\n22 cameras or bags and -- and don\\'t have their\\n\\n\\n23 hands on them. But I\\'m going to say, as every\\n\\n\\n24 woman who carries around handbags knows, that\\'s\\n\\n\\n25 just the normal way you carry around a handbag.\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n1\\n\\nSo -- so -- so that would be the usual\\n\\n\\n2 case, maybe not the always case, but it\\'s the\\n\\n\\n3 usual case of bag snatching that you say falls\\n\\n\\n4 under the robbery definition.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nMR. LIU: And I think what\\'s important\\n\\n\\n6 to remember about even that case is that there\\n\\n\\n7 is force on the one hand being applied by the\\n\\n\\n8 victim which is being met by force on the other\\n\\n\\n9 being applied by the defendant. And what that\\n\\n\\n10 amounts to is a physical struggle over a piece\\n\\n\\n11 of property. I think it -\\n\\n12\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the problem is\\n\\n\\n13 --\\n\\n14\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah, I mean -- I\\'m\\n\\n\\n15 sorry.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'m sorry. The\\n\\n\\n17 problem is, just in common parlance, the\\n\\n\\n18 definition that the courts have given in\\n\\n\\n19 Florida is the slightest resistance qualifies\\n\\n\\n20 as violent force so that if the victim just\\n\\n\\n21 merely moves you away and you push him back -\\n\\n22\\n\\nMR. LIU: I don\\'t think that\\'s -\\n\\n23\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that\\'s the\\n\\n\\n24 slightest force.\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, but I think what\\'s -\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n35\\n\\n1 what\\'s important to keep in mind -- I guess\\n\\n\\n2 this finishes my answer to Justice Kagan -- is\\n\\n\\n3 that what is inherent in the offense every time\\n\\n\\n4 it occurs in Florida is this violent contest\\n\\n\\n5 over a piece of property.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nAnd I think it\\'s natural to conceive\\n\\n\\n7 of the force necessary to prevail in such a\\n\\n\\n8 contest as force capable of causing -\\n\\n9\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s not the\\n\\n\\n10 words the Court has used. It said the\\n\\n\\n11 slightest resistance and the slightest force\\n\\n\\n12 used to overcome it qualify as a robbery.\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nAnd under the categorical approach, I\\n\\n\\n14 thought that we had to eliminate something that\\n\\n\\n15 was slight.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, I think it\\'s true that\\n\\n\\n17 what -- that the -- that the resistance can be\\n\\n\\n18 of any degree, but I think you have to view\\n\\n\\n19 that resistance -\\n\\n20\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the force can\\n\\n\\n21 be of any degree?\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, but I think what\\'s key\\n\\n\\n23 is -- is the context in which that interaction\\n\\n\\n24 is occurring. When you have force on the one\\n\\n\\n25 hand being met by force on the other, what you\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n1 have is a fight over the property. And I think\\n\\n\\n2 that is a quintessentially -\\n\\n3\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, because what\\n\\n\\n4 you have is slight force over slight -- slight\\n\\n\\n5 resistance and slight force to overcome it.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nMR.

LIU: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\\n\\n\\n2 think that quote comes from a case called\\n\\n\\n3 McCloud from 1976 -- I mean from 1972. The -\\n\\n4 the -- the Florida Supreme Court in Robinson in\\n\\n\\n5 1997 said that that was merely dicta and, in\\n\\n\\n6 fact, pointed to one Florida intermediate court\\n\\n\\n7 case that had read that literally to mean any,\\n\\n\\n8 and expressly disapproved that holding.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: Well, counsel, I\\'m\\n\\n\\n10 not sure that quite solves the problem, though,\\n\\n\\n11 because the statute on its face says not just\\n\\n\\n12 force or violence or assault, but it says \"or\\n\\n\\n13 putting in fear.\" That is sufficient to\\n\\n\\n14 constitute robbery in Florida.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nMR. LIU: Right.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: And Robinson I\\'m not\\n\\n\\n17 sure helps you very much because I think it\\'s\\n\\n\\n18 susceptible to a reading of saying, in the\\n\\n\\n19 cases of purse snatching where force is alleged\\n\\n\\n20 as the mode for creating a robbery, then you\\n\\n\\n21 need whatever -- whatever you\\'ve been talking\\n\\n\\n22 about with Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor.\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\nBut I don\\'t read Robinson as\\n\\n\\n24 suggesting force is the only way of\\n\\n\\n25 establishing robbery under Florida or doing\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n38\\n\\n1 anything to eliminate the disjunctive language\\n\\n\\n2 of \"or putting in fear.\"\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nMR.

LIU: Because the Florida courts\\n\\n\\n23 have construed \"putting in fear\" to mean a fear\\n\\n\\n24 of bodily injury.

LIU: So we look at the text of\\n\\n\\n7 the Armed Career Criminal Act and it says: Any\\n\\n\\n8 -- any felony offense that has as an element\\n\\n\\n9 the use or threatened use of force.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why there hasn\\'t been any\\n\\n\\n11 debate about why the putting in fear prong\\n\\n\\n12 satisfies the elements.\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: So you think the\\n\\n\\n14 putting in fear prong is always and can only be\\n\\n\\n15 accomplished by threats of force?\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nMR.

LIU: It\\'s a case we cite in the\\n\\n\\n3 beginning of our argument section called\\n\\n\\n4 Baldwin versus State that gave that\\n\\n\\n5 interpretation. Bodily harm is the\\n\\n\\n6 quintessential injury that satisfies the Curtis\\n\\n\\n7 Johnson standard. And so a threat of such harm\\n\\n\\n8 is going to be threatened use of force under\\n\\n\\n9 the ACCA. And that\\'s why no one has disputed\\n\\n\\n10 that in this entire case.\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nI -- I guess I\\'d like to return to the\\n\\n\\n12 -- I guess I\\'d like to turn to Petitioner\\'s\\n\\n\\n13 test and -- and -\\n\\n14\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Liu, could I ask\\n\\n\\n15 before you do that, you keep referring to the\\n\\n\\n16 common law, but I had thought that the whole\\n\\n\\n17 structure of the Curtis Johnson opinion is to\\n\\n\\n18 say, well, we have this common law definition,\\n\\n\\n19 but it\\'s in the context of a statute which is\\n\\n\\n20 trying to identify violent felonies. And in\\n\\n\\n21 that particular context, Justice Scalia said\\n\\n\\n22 we\\'re going to ignore the common law definition\\n\\n\\n23 and, instead, use an ordinary language\\n\\n\\n24 definition of what \"force\" is.\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nAnd he basically says physical force\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n41\\n\\n1 in the context of a statute that is trying to\\n\\n\\n2 define violent felonies is violent force,\\n\\n\\n3 substantial force, and so forth.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nSo why -- why is this common law\\n\\n\\n5 argument relevant at all?\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, I think it\\'s relevant\\n\\n\\n7 for a number of reasons. First of all, Curtis\\n\\n\\n8 Johnson did reject a common law definition, but\\n\\n\\n9 the common law definition it rejected was one\\n\\n\\n10 drawn from a misdemeanor offense.\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nCurtis Johnson didn\\'t call into\\n\\n\\n12 question that a felony definition of force\\n\\n\\n13 might fit. And this one does fit perfectly.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nYou\\'re right that Johnson also\\n\\n\\n15 referenced the ordinary meaning of \"force\" in\\n\\n\\n16 terms -\\n\\n17\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It didn\\'t reference\\n\\n\\n18 it. The whole argument -- the whole decision\\n\\n\\n19 was based on that.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nMR. LIU: And I -- and that\\'s why I -\\n\\n21 I think I would return to what I was saying\\n\\n\\n22 earlier. I think if you took someone off the\\n\\n\\n23 -- in every -- in everyday English and -- and\\n\\n\\n24 explained to them what happens in these cases,\\n\\n\\n25 where someone resists, that resistance is\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n42\\n\\n1 physically overpowered by someone else, I think\\n\\n\\n2 \"violence\" is actually the word a lot of people\\n\\n\\n3 would use.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nIt also is the word the common law has\\n\\n\\n5 used for centuries. It\\'s the -- it\\'s the word\\n\\n\\n6 \"violence\" that\\'s found in the statutes of\\n\\n\\n7 dozens of states. And it\\'s the word that\\n\\n\\n8 Congress used when it enacted the basic robbery\\n\\n\\n9 definition in the \\'84 Act.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nIt regarded this type of robbery,\\n\\n\\n11 Congress regarded this type of robbery, common\\n\\n\\n12 law robbery, as one of the most violent street\\n\\n\\n13 crimes -- one of the most common violent street\\n\\n\\n14 crimes that existed.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nAnd so I think this ordinary approach,\\n\\n\\n16 this ordinary language approach to how we would\\n\\n\\n17 use violence in -- in ordinary English actually\\n\\n\\n18 cuts against -\\n\\n19\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess the ordinary\\n\\n\\n20 English view is something like, look, when I\\'m\\n\\n\\n21 walking down the street and somebody puts a -\\n\\n22 a gun in the air and says give me your money,\\n\\n\\n23 that I know, I understand to be a violent\\n\\n\\n24 offense.\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nBut, when I\\'m walking down the street\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n43\\n\\n1 and somebody grabs my handbag, I\\'m not happy\\n\\n\\n2 about that, but it\\'s -- it just doesn\\'t have\\n\\n\\n3 that violent aspect of it in ordinary language\\n\\n\\n4 that I think, you know, beating somebody up\\n\\n\\n5 does, putting a gun in their face does.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nAnd this is a -- a state that defines\\n\\n\\n7 robbery so broadly that you tell me it\\n\\n\\n8 basically includes every bag snatcher.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, I guess -- I guess\\n\\n\\n10 what I would say to that is whether -- whether\\n\\n\\n11 -- you know, what I would say is the key point\\n\\n\\n12 is what Congress thought, and I -- and I think\\n\\n\\n13 all the indications are that Congress regarded\\n\\n\\n14 this as violent.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But what is the \"this\"\\n\\n\\n16 that Congress thought? I mean, in all of these\\n\\n\\n17 cases, we have to look to whether the state has\\n\\n\\n18 defined its crime more broadly than the basic\\n\\n\\n19 offense.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, the idea that Florida\\n\\n\\n21 here is somehow an outlier among common law\\n\\n\\n22 jurisdictions is just not correct. The Florida\\n\\n\\n23 case law tracks exactly the sort of case law we\\n\\n\\n24 found in the common law treatises dating back\\n\\n\\n25 to Blackstone.\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n44\\n\\n1\\n\\nAnd that was the notion of violence\\n\\n\\n2 that Congress had in mind when it wrote the\\n\\n\\n3 definition of \"robbery\" in the \\'84 Act. Two\\n\\n\\n4 years later, Congress\\'s intent was to expand\\n\\n\\n5 the scope of the ACCA. That was the very title\\n\\n\\n6 in the text of the -\\n\\n7\\n\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was\\n\\n\\n8 through the residual clause? The -\\n\\n9\\n\\nMR. LIU: No, Your Honor. Congress at\\n\\n\\n10 the same time made clear that it thought\\n\\n\\n11 robbery as defined in the \\'84 Act would satisfy\\n\\n\\n12 the elements clause. It wasn\\'t -- it wasn\\'t\\n\\n\\n13 depending on the residual clause to do the work\\n\\n\\n14 of the elements clause.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nWe know that from both the text and\\n\\n\\n16 the history of the \\'84 Act and the \\'86 Act\\n\\n\\n17 because, starting with the text, Congress took\\n\\n\\n18 the very key element in its robbery definition,\\n\\n\\n19 force, and made that the centerpiece of the\\n\\n\\n20 elements clause.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: But -- but Curtis\\n\\n\\n22 Johnson says substantial degree of force, as\\n\\n\\n23 Justice Kagan points out, and how are we\\n\\n\\n24 supposed to deal with that language in the\\n\\n\\n25 Curtis Johnson opinion if we\\'re trying to\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n45\\n\\n1 follow Curtis Johnson strictly?\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, Justice Kavanaugh, the\\n\\n\\n3 force used -- the type of force involved in a\\n\\n\\n4 Florida robbery or any common law robbery is\\n\\n\\n5 substantial in two ways Curtis Johnson itself\\n\\n\\n6 found relevant.\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nThe first is this kind of force is\\n\\n\\n8 force capable of causing physical pain or\\n\\n\\n9 injury. That\\'s what Curtis Johnson meant by\\n\\n\\n10 \"substantial.\" The two sentences, one follows\\n\\n\\n11 right after the other.\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nThe second -\\n\\n13\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could -- force capable\\n\\n\\n14 of causing physical pain or injury, I mean, it\\n\\n\\n15 touches capable of causing physical pain or\\n\\n\\n16 injury when done in the wrong context. I\\'m\\n\\n\\n17 standing at the top of a stairs, somebody\\n\\n\\n18 startles me by putting his hand on my shoulder,\\n\\n\\n19 I fall down the stairs, I break my leg, that\\'s\\n\\n\\n20 capable of causing physical pain and injury, it\\n\\n\\n21 just caused physical pain and injury.\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nSo why doesn\\'t your test -- why isn\\'t\\n\\n\\n23 it defeated even by the holding of Curtis\\n\\n\\n24 Johnson, the -- the particular application of\\n\\n\\n25 Curtis Johnson?\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n46\\n\\n1\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, we -- we -- it appears\\n\\n\\n2 there\\'s common ground here. We -- we\\n\\n\\n3 absolutely agree that whether something is\\n\\n\\n4 violent has to be evaluated in the context.\\n\\n\\n5 And a tap on the shoulder, I think, if -- if\\n\\n\\n6 you pulled someone off the street and said is a\\n\\n\\n7 tap on the shoulder without more violent, that\\n\\n\\n8 person would say no.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nBut, as I was saying, if you describe\\n\\n\\n10 to them the -- the situations that are inherent\\n\\n\\n11 in a Florida robbery offense, a physical\\n\\n\\n12 contest where two people are fighting over a\\n\\n\\n13 piece of property, that is quintessentially\\n\\n\\n14 violent and has been so -\\n\\n15\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, I\\'m sorry -\\n\\n16\\n\\nMR. LIU: -- for centuries.\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you keep using\\n\\n\\n18 the word \"fight.\" But the statute just says\\n\\n\\n19 the least resistance met by the least force.\\n\\n\\n20 That\\'s not a fight in my dictionary.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nThe fact that somebody has something\\n\\n\\n22 and pulls back and you just walk away with it,\\n\\n\\n23 that\\'s not substantial force.\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nMR. LIU: Oh, it -- it -- it is,\\n\\n\\n25 because whatever the resistance, the form the\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n47\\n\\n1 resistance that the victim is providing, is\\n\\n\\n2 being physically overpowered by the defendant.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nAnd -\\n\\n4\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But how does that\\n\\n\\n5 define it as a substantial force? Even as\\n\\n\\n6 capable of producing injury, if the example\\n\\n\\n7 that the Chief used, an elderly victim, just\\n\\n\\n8 simply can be overcome with no -- virtually no\\n\\n\\n9 force whatsoever?\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, I don\\'t -- I don\\'t -\\n\\n11\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then that\\'s not\\n\\n\\n12 capable of causing injury, even in an elderly\\n\\n\\n13 person?\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nMR. LIU: Again -- again, the force\\n\\n\\n15 shouldn\\'t be measured in some quantitative\\n\\n\\n16 respect, like foot pounds or force meters.\\n\\n\\n17 Force does have to be evaluated in the context.\\n\\n\\n18 And so, yes, in some cases, the degree of\\n\\n\\n19 resistance may be small.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. How\\n\\n\\n21 about a pickpocket that walks away and someone\\n\\n\\n22 grabs them lightly and they just pull their arm\\n\\n\\n23 and keep walking? As I read the Florida\\n\\n\\n24 statute, that would cover that as well. Not\\n\\n\\n25 force directed by the victim or resistance by\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n48\\n\\n1 the victim but resistance by someone else in\\n\\n\\n2 the course of the taking.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nMR. LIU: Right.

LIU: Oh.\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\\'m sorry. The\\n\\n\\n12 thief walks over, pickpockets the victim, turns\\n\\n\\n13 around, starts to walk away, and a passerby\\n\\n\\n14 grabs hold of his arm, and he pulls it away and\\n\\n\\n15 keeps walking.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nMR.

LIU: Well, Congress thought so.\\n\\n\\n2 We know that because Congress adopted this very\\n\\n\\n3 definition of \"robbery\" in the \\'84 Act.\\n\\n\\n4 Robbery, common law robbery, was an original\\n\\n\\n5 ACCA predicate. And in doing so, Congress\\n\\n\\n6 described these types of robberies as the most\\n\\n\\n7 common violent street crimes.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why does burglary end\\n\\n\\n9 up as an enumerated crime and robbery does not\\n\\n\\n10 when Congress changed the Act?\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nMR. LIU: Because it wasn\\'t necessary\\n\\n\\n12 to enumerate robbery, given that Congress was\\n\\n\\n13 taking an element of robbery and making it the\\n\\n\\n14 basis of the elements clause.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nBy contrast, there was a lot more\\n\\n\\n16 doubt about whether the ACCA -- the new ACCA\\n\\n\\n17 without a specific reference to burglary would\\n\\n\\n18 have covered burglary. This Court recognized\\n\\n\\n19 that on pages 584 to 589 of Taylor. There was\\n\\n\\n20 a concern that burglary would be inadvertently\\n\\n\\n21 left out.\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nBut there was -- there could be no\\n\\n\\n23 such concern with robbery because Congress did\\n\\n\\n24 the most straightforward thing it could do to\\n\\n\\n25 ensure that the new Act covered robbery, and\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n1 not just robbery but also things like rape and\\n\\n\\n2 murder.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nWhat it did was it took that element,\\n\\n\\n4 thus guaranteeing that all the \\'84 covered\\n\\n\\n5 robberies would -- would come along with it,\\n\\n\\n6 and made that the basis such that other crimes\\n\\n\\n7 too -- rape, murder, et cetera -- would -\\n\\n8 would come in as well. So there just simply\\n\\n\\n9 was no need for Congress to re-enumerate\\n\\n\\n10 robbery.\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nAnd the indications we have from the\\n\\n\\n12 text and the history are that Congress thought\\n\\n\\n13 the old ACCA was working perfectly well.\\n\\n\\n14 Senator Specter got up and said: Look, we want\\n\\n\\n15 to include everything that was included in the\\n\\n\\n16 old one, and we want to expand it.\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nAnd this Court in Taylor noted the\\n\\n\\n18 same thing.

And so -\\n\\n21\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Ms. -- Ms. Bryn says\\n\\n\\n22 that her understanding of what Curtis Johnson\\n\\n\\n23 requires would have a minimal effect on the\\n\\n\\n24 robbery statutes of the states.

There\\'s no indication\\n\\n\\n8 that Florida is an outlier.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nAll of those states would be knocked\\n\\n\\n10 out.

LIU: I say only the basic robbery\\n\\n\\n20 is knocked out, but I think that\\'s the right\\n\\n\\n21 focus because we know from the \\'84 Act Congress\\n\\n\\n22 was concerned about keeping in basic robbery.\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\nYou look at the definition in the \\'84\\n\\n\\n24 Act, it\\'s not armed robbery, it\\'s not\\n\\n\\n25 aggravated robbery; it\\'s simple common law\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n53\\n\\n1 robbery.\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: Let -- let\\'s put\\n\\n\\n3 that aside for the moment, say we disagree with\\n\\n\\n4 you.

LIU: Basic robbery statutes?\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: No. Basic or\\n\\n\\n9 aggravated.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMR. LIU: Basic or aggravated, it\\'s -\\n\\n11 we don\\'t have the exact number. Part of that\\n\\n\\n12 is because Petitioner is unwilling to commit to\\n\\n\\n13 whether some of those aggravated states\\n\\n\\n14 actually qualify.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nSo the aggravated -- the aggravated\\n\\n\\n16 factor that Petitioner points to is an element\\n\\n\\n17 in the offense that requires a showing of\\n\\n\\n18 actual injury, the causation of injury as an\\n\\n\\n19 element. But Petitioner, on page 8 of his\\n\\n\\n20 reply brief, isn\\'t even willing to say whether\\n\\n\\n21 those offenses qualify.\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: But, if they did\\n\\n\\n23 qualify, then how many states are affected?\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nMR. LIU: I don\\'t have an exact\\n\\n\\n25 number. I think it would be maybe two dozen\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n54\\n\\n1 states that would qualify. But I just want to\\n\\n\\n2 reiterate I think that is the wrong lens to\\n\\n\\n3 look at this issue because Congress, when it\\n\\n\\n4 wrote a basic robbery definition to \\'84 and\\n\\n\\n5 then wanted to expand the ACCA, didn\\'t -\\n\\n6 didn\\'t think the expanded ACCA was then going\\n\\n\\n7 to cut back and limit the coverage of the ACCA\\n\\n\\n8 to only a small subset of robberies that\\n\\n\\n9 qualified as armed and aggravated.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: The -- the problem I\\n\\n\\n11 -- I have with that, counsel, and hopefully you\\n\\n\\n12 can help me with this, is you keep coming back\\n\\n\\n13 to the -- the -- the belief that Congress\\n\\n\\n14 wished to or intended to keep in common law\\n\\n\\n15 robbery in its simple form, but Curtis Johnson\\n\\n\\n16 expressly rejects the common law definition of\\n\\n\\n17 force.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nMR. LIU: No, it -\\n\\n19\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: So -\\n\\n20\\n\\nMR. LIU: -- it rejected the common\\n\\n\\n21 law definition of force -\\n\\n22\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: -- what do we do\\n\\n\\n23 about that?\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nMR. LIU: -- that came from a\\n\\n\\n25 misdemeanor offense.\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n55\\n\\n1\\n\\nWhat was key in Curtis Johnson was\\n\\n\\n2 that the key term being defined was \"violent\\n\\n\\n3 felony.\" And so Justice Scalia said it would\\n\\n\\n4 have been a comical misfit, a mismatch -\\n\\n5\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: Well, as the dissent\\n\\n\\n6 pointed out and -- and the majority\\n\\n\\n7 acknowledged, the misdemeanor/felony line at\\n\\n\\n8 common law simply meant: One, you\\'re put to\\n\\n\\n9 death, and the other you\\'re put in prison. So\\n\\n\\n10 it wasn\\'t -- it wasn\\'t quite the same line that\\n\\n\\n11 we have today.\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nAnd that was the common law definition\\n\\n\\n13 of robbery. Robbery was a misdemeanor -\\n\\n14\\n\\nMR. LIU: No, robbery was a -\\n\\n15\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: -- often.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nMR. LIU: -- robbery was a felony at\\n\\n\\n17 common law.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: Often it was. But\\n\\n\\n19 the force required was very minimal at common\\n\\n\\n20 law. And the majority expressly rejects that\\n\\n\\n21 in Curtis Johnson as sufficient to satisfy the\\n\\n\\n22 statute.\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\nNow maybe that\\'s wrong. Maybe you\\n\\n\\n24 want to revisit Curtis Johnson. I\\'ve heard a\\n\\n\\n25 lot of arguments today that seem along those\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n56\\n\\n1 lines. But what do we do if we don\\'t?\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, I -- it -- it\\'s not\\n\\n\\n3 true that Curtis Johnson rejected this -- this\\n\\n\\n4 -- this definition of \"force.\" The definition\\n\\n\\n5 of \"force\" that Curtis Johnson rejected was one\\n\\n\\n6 that could be satisfied by the merest touching.\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nAnd common -\\n\\n8\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: Which we\\n\\n\\n9 acknowledged was the common law definition.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMR. LIU: Was the common law\\n\\n\\n11 definition that came from the misdemeanor\\n\\n\\n12 offense of battery.\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nCommon law robbery, which has a felony\\n\\n\\n14 definition of force, force overcoming\\n\\n\\n15 resistance, cannot be satisfied by the merest\\n\\n\\n16 touching. We know that because not only do the\\n\\n\\n17 treatises say so, but Florida in particular has\\n\\n\\n18 said so in the Walker case, which involved a -\\n\\n19 a -- a mere touching where someone took -- took\\n\\n\\n20 away someone\\'s property, and that did not rise\\n\\n\\n21 to the level of common law robbery. And so -\\n\\n22\\n\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you -- what\\n\\n\\n23 do you do with the express statement in Curtis\\n\\n\\n24 Johnson that the word \"violent\" in 924(e)(2)(B)\\n\\n\\n25 connotes a substantial degree of force?\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n57\\n\\n1\\n\\nMR. LIU: We -- we have three\\n\\n\\n2 responses. Once -- one, the substantialness of\\n\\n\\n3 the force has to be understood in context. And\\n\\n\\n4 in the context of a physical struggle, I think\\n\\n\\n5 people would call that force substantial or\\n\\n\\n6 violent.\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This really has -\\n\\n8 sounds like we\\'re overruling Johnson and\\n\\n\\n9 reintroducing into the categorical approach\\n\\n\\n10 this whole notion of what\\'s the normal\\n\\n\\n11 situation.\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nI -- I -- I guess, if I\\'m looking at\\n\\n\\n13 something in a categorical way, I\\'m saying\\n\\n\\n14 little force is not substantial force, period,\\n\\n\\n15 end of story.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nMR.

LIU: And Curtis Johnson didn\\'t\\n\\n\\n21 adopt a quantitative measure of force. Yes, I\\n\\n\\n22 -- I will acknowledge that if you measured the\\n\\n\\n23 force in some of these cases on a quantitative\\n\\n\\n24 basis, we\\'re not going to get to a lot of\\n\\n\\n25 Newton\\'s or foot pounds or foot meters -\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n58\\n\\n1\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re not\\n\\n\\n2 going to even get to pain -\\n\\n3\\n\\nMR. LIU: But -\\n\\n4\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and suffering.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nMR. LIU: -- but Curtis Johnson made\\n\\n\\n6 clear that that wasn\\'t the right inquiry. It\\'s\\n\\n\\n7 a qualitative assessment. It -- the words\\n\\n\\n8 \"capable of causing injury\" were a gloss on the\\n\\n\\n9 word \"violent.\"\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nAnd I go back to what I said earlier.\\n\\n\\n11 This sort of interaction, a physical struggle\\n\\n\\n12 between two people over a piece of property,\\n\\n\\n13 has been regarded as violent in the common law\\n\\n\\n14 by Congress, by over 40 states for hundreds -\\n\\n15 for a very long time.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn\\'t the standard\\n\\n\\n17 force sufficient to overcome resistance a\\n\\n\\n18 quantification? That\\'s a way of quantifying\\n\\n\\n19 how much force is necessary.\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nSo the -- the force that is required\\n\\n\\n21 for a battery, the merest touching, is -- is\\n\\n\\n22 not enough, but there has to be a substantial\\n\\n\\n23 amount, a quantifiable amount, and the\\n\\n\\n24 quantification is the amount of force necessary\\n\\n\\n25 to overcome resistance.\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n1\\n\\nIf you don\\'t adopt that, then I do\\n\\n\\n2 think you have to get to foot pounds or\\n\\n\\n3 something like that.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, no, that -- that\\'s\\n\\n\\n5 sort of -- I think I\\'m agreeing with you more\\n\\n\\n6 than disagreeing, Justice Alito.\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nI -- I -- I don\\'t think we should\\n\\n\\n8 measure force in terms of some statistic or -\\n\\n9 or -- or, you know, exact degree.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nI think -- I think the force used has\\n\\n\\n11 to be understood in context. And I think the\\n\\n\\n12 -- the sort of force that is necessary to\\n\\n\\n13 overcome someone\\'s resistance is going to be\\n\\n\\n14 more than a mere touching and is the sort -- is\\n\\n\\n15 the type of violence that has been regarded as\\n\\n\\n16 violent by the common law and, even more\\n\\n\\n17 relevant, Congress.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess, Mr. Liu, the\\n\\n\\n19 problem I\\'m having in a nutshell is you keep on\\n\\n\\n20 referring to this as a physical struggle over\\n\\n\\n21 property, but at the same time, you tell me\\n\\n\\n22 that if somebody snatches a bag off my\\n\\n\\n23 shoulder, it\\'s -- it counts as robbery -\\n\\n24\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, I -\\n\\n25\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- under Florida law.\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n60\\n\\n1\\n\\nAnd, to me, that is not a physical\\n\\n\\n2 struggle over property. And if a state defines\\n\\n\\n3 its robbery statute that broadly so as to\\n\\n\\n4 include, you know, thefts of property but that\\n\\n\\n5 are not done with physical contestation,\\n\\n\\n6 physical struggle, then the state has made a\\n\\n\\n7 choice.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nMR. LIU: And, Justice Kagan, I -- I\\n\\n\\n9 think we just disagree about what\\'s covered by\\n\\n\\n10 state law then because I don\\'t think a simple\\n\\n\\n11 purse snatching or pickpocketing -- those\\n\\n\\n12 things were the very reason -- was the very\\n\\n\\n13 reason for Robinson.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nRobinson, the Florida Supreme Court\\n\\n\\n15 case, the very reason for it was to clarify\\n\\n\\n16 that those sorts of things are punished as\\n\\n\\n17 theft, as larceny, as sudden snatching -\\n\\n18\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I go back to what\\n\\n\\n19 your answers to my first questions were. I\\'m\\n\\n\\n20 carrying my bag with my hand over the strap,\\n\\n\\n21 and you say when somebody wrests the bag from\\n\\n\\n22 me, that\\'s -- that that\\'s robbery.\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\nMR. LIU: But -\\n\\n24\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And I say that\\'s every\\n\\n\\n25 bag snatching in America, save a few.\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n61\\n\\n1\\n\\nMR. LIU: Well, but I think only in a\\n\\n\\n2 case where there is actual victim resistance,\\n\\n\\n3 physical resistance to the taking. In a case\\n\\n\\n4 where that\\'s absent, like the AJ case discussed\\n\\n\\n5 in Robinson itself, that\\'s not going to rise to\\n\\n\\n6 the level of a robbery. That\\'s going to be\\n\\n\\n7 prosecuted, if at all, only as a theft or a\\n\\n\\n8 larceny.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nAnd so I think what the question\\n\\n\\n10 before this Court boils down to is whether it\\n\\n\\n11 should recognize a line between violent and\\n\\n\\n12 non-violent takings.\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: But -- but,\\n\\n\\n14 counsel, can I -- I say one thing on Curtis\\n\\n\\n15 Johnson there, which is it says violent force.\\n\\n\\n16 And if I -- if it stopped there, I think you\\n\\n\\n17 might have an issue, but then it says \"that is\\n\\n\\n18 force capable of causing physical pain or\\n\\n\\n19 injury to another person.\"\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nAnd \"capable of\" seems to me much\\n\\n\\n21 different from what we usually, as Justice\\n\\n\\n22 Kagan would say, think of as violent force.\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\nSo maybe -- maybe there\\'s something in\\n\\n\\n24 Curtis Johnson itself, we\\'ve talked a lot about\\n\\n\\n25 it, but in that one sentence, it says \"violent\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n62\\n\\n1 force\" and it says something else that seems\\n\\n\\n2 intention with violent force.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nMR. LIU: Mr. Chief Justice, may I\\n\\n\\n4 answer?\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nMR. LIU: I think the capable language\\n\\n\\n7 is a gloss on violent. I think it is an\\n\\n\\n8 ordinary English way of translating, of\\n\\n\\n9 spelling out what \"violent\" means.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nAnd I think whether you look at\\n\\n\\n11 violent or the capable language, common law\\n\\n\\n12 robbery is -- satisfies that -- that -- that\\n\\n\\n13 definition.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\\n\\n\\n15 counsel.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nMs. Bryn, you have four minutes\\n\\n\\n17 remaining.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRENDA G. BRYN\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nMS. BRYN: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nYour Honor, at common law, no physical\\n\\n\\n22 resistance was even required for robbery. The\\n\\n\\n23 classic example from Blackstone is pulling a\\n\\n\\n24 watch chain and snapping a watch off of\\n\\n\\n25 someone. The person doesn\\'t have to do\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n63\\n\\n1 anything.\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nSo, under the government\\'s view here,\\n\\n\\n3 that would constitute violent force, where\\n\\n\\n4 there wasn\\'t even any -- it\\'s a fiction if\\n\\n\\n5 resistance was implied in the watch chain at\\n\\n\\n6 common law. Common law resistance was so\\n\\n\\n7 broad, and that was the intent in \\'84.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nBut let me just say Florida robbery\\n\\n\\n9 would not even need the 1984 definition because\\n\\n\\n10 Florida\\'s expanded the temporal scope of\\n\\n\\n11 robbery far beyond the common law so that there\\n\\n\\n12 -- so Florida robbery today is essentially\\n\\n\\n13 shoplifting and pickpocketing, plus resisting\\n\\n\\n14 apprehension in some way.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nNow to include these slight force\\n\\n\\n16 robberies as a predicate for a -- an\\n\\n\\n17 enhancement that would start at 15 years\\n\\n\\n18 imprisonment and authorize a penalty up to life\\n\\n\\n19 is really inconsistent with Congress\\'s purpose\\n\\n\\n20 of identifying the worst of the worst\\n\\n\\n21 offenders, exactly those offenders who would be\\n\\n\\n22 likely not only to possess a gun but kill\\n\\n\\n23 someone with a gun.\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nAnd there is no predictive value from\\n\\n\\n25 using slight force to snap a bag or pull a\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n64\\n\\n1 dollar bill or even just pull one\\'s arm away\\n\\n\\n2 from a security guard that would be predictive\\n\\n\\n3 of the willingness to use violent force.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nIf Congress finds that the result in\\n\\n\\n5 this case is counterintuitive, not what it\\n\\n\\n6 intended, and it really wants slight force\\n\\n\\n7 robberies to qualify as violent felonies\\n\\n\\n8 sufficient to support that enhancement, it\\'s in\\n\\n\\n9 Congress\\'s hands.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nThey can easily rewrite this statute.\\n\\n\\n11 There were two definitions originally. All\\n\\n\\n12 robberies came within the residual clause for\\n\\n\\n13 many, many years. This has only become a\\n\\n\\n14 question after the elimination of the residual\\n\\n\\n15 clause, and Congress has multiple resources -\\n\\n16\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the residual\\n\\n\\n17 clause referred to \"capable of causing\" -- I\\'m\\n\\n\\n18 sorry -- \"a serious risk of physical injury.\"\\n\\n\\n19 So how would common law robbery come within\\n\\n\\n20 that?\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nMS. BRYN: It -- it -- it -- just by\\n\\n\\n22 the possibility of a confrontation afterwards,\\n\\n\\n23 which was the way -- which was the standard\\n\\n\\n24 this Court used for the residual clause crimes,\\n\\n\\n25 which swept in pickpocketing -\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n65\\n\\n1\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: I\\'m sorry, you think\\n\\n\\n2 that -\\n\\n3\\n\\nMS. BRYN: -- and all these offenses\\n\\n\\n4 that Congress -\\n\\n5\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- you think that\\n\\n\\n6 common law robbery involves a serious risk of\\n\\n\\n7 physical injury?\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nMS. BRYN: No. I -- I -\\n\\n9\\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then how would it fall\\n\\n\\n10 within the residual clause, which is what you\\n\\n\\n11 just said?\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nMS. BRYN: I\\'m -- I\\'m -- I\\'m not\\n\\n\\n13 saying that, Your Honor. I\\'m saying that, as\\n\\n\\n14 applied, as the residual clause was applied,\\n\\n\\n15 because the language was so capacious and the\\n\\n\\n16 standard was unclear and it focused on a\\n\\n\\n17 hypothetical possible confrontation, one could\\n\\n\\n18 hypothesize a confrontation after\\n\\n\\n19 pickpocketings, after shopliftings, and,\\n\\n\\n20 ultimately, the residual clause swept in\\n\\n\\n21 everything.\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I believe it was\\n\\n\\n23 invalidated by this Court. But now this Court\\n\\n\\n24 cannot compensate for the loss of the residual\\n\\n\\n25 clause by reading the elements clause beyond\\n\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n\\n66\\n\\n1 its terms, and one very important term is \"has\\n\\n\\n2 as an element.\"\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nCongress dictated the categorical\\n\\n\\n4 approach. If it doesn\\'t like the results of\\n\\n\\n5 the categorical approach, it can easily rewrite\\n\\n\\n6 ACCA.\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nThank you. I ask Your Honor to affirm\\n\\n\\n8 -- to reverse the decision below.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n(Laughter.)\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nMS.
