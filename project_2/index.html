      <p class="body-text">A little bit more than 30 people live in the hilly Swiss municipality Schelten in the Jura region. In Schelten almost everybody works in the rural sector. And these farmers don't seem to care about air pollution.</p>
      <p class="body-text">According to an analysis of a data set from the Swiss Federal Road Office the People in Schelten have per Car and Kilometer the highest Carbon Dioxid Emissions of all the 2200 Municipalities. The Emission per Car in Schelten is more than 200 C02 per Kilometer. This is almost the double of the Municipality with the lowest car emissions. The average amount of all Municipalities is around 160.</p>
      <p class="body-text">It's possible that Schelten got on the first place as a coincidence. But the data tell another story: All the Top Ten Municipalities are located in mountainous areas either in the Jura like Schelten or in the Alps.</p>

      <p class="body-text">As the map shows the people in the Frech and the Italien part of Switzerland seem to care more about the environment. Compared to the Swiss German part of Switzerland and to the mountainous regions they have significant deeper values.</p>
